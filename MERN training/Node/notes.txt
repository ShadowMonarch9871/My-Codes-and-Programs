Working of Http1 - Client sends req to the server, browser process it initially and then generate a sep req to fetch the data from the server. This is not good cuz user has to wait for long time while the browser parses the res, which lead to increase the load time and dec the performance of the application.

Working of Http2 - It has push capabilities, with the help of push capabilities the server can send the assests to the browser initially, thus improving performance.
